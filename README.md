AudioEndpointControl: A library to access and control audio devices (Soundcard speakers/mics) written in Python, no DLLs are needed (at the moment at least) it communicates directly with Windows Core Audio Interfaces.

I'll expand this readme with more details later. look at "EndpointExample.py" for example use of the library API, keep the library in its "AudioEndpointControl" directory.

The "EndpointExample.py" is basically the documentation at the moment, I'll try to improve it while I add more functionality.

It should be usable, but there are mostly no error checking and there are probably bugsa galo
